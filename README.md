These are my projects(course &amp; etc). Hope you find them usefull 

 1.Headball(Jan 2022) 
 I designed this game in CodeBlocks environment using C++ programming and SDL2 graphics. It is more of a simplified version of the famous one. All of necessary files including explanations(persian) are provided as a zip file just make sure about directions on your device. I suggest you to take a quick look at main file.

 2.EEG BioMarker
 Preprocessing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing some analytical simulations such as PLV and ttest on them, was the main task of this project. Three group of people(AD:Alzheimer’s Disease-norma-MCI:Mild Cognitive Impairment) were examined(By different odor sensing) and brain EEG signals were provided to do this task. Moreover, the relation between the three subjects and possible transition were analyzed. The was carried out via matlab and toolbox EEGlab.

 3.FMCW
 The aim of this project was to educate radar funtionality and the possibility to use them as a **basis for data transmission and receive**. First was education: an almost 4 hour workshop was provided to present radaring operations and a paper about index modulating radars. Second was implementation: using index modulation methods to deliver data on chirp signals,generating random data chirp indexes - transmitting and receiving data considering AWGN channel.
